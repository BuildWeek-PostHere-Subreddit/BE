Hello Russ! These are notes I have for you as I edit this shared back-end

### Files Changed
server.js:
-switched the initial GET request to something that can be parsed by a browser
-added dotenv to the beginning of the file to use environment variables in the server js file.

### Files Added

### Files Removed
I don't plan on removing any files, but just in case, I will leave this here!
